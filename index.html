I am currently a software engineer at Kodiak Robotics.
We are a startup working on self-driving trucks (and of course, we're hiring!).

</br></br>

I am a roboticist working at the intersection of machine learning, planning and decision-making, and imitation learning.
Broadly, I am interested in enabling robots to address challenging problems in smart and useful ways,
usually through a combination of state-of-the-art research, rigorous software development processes, system integration, and field testing.

I've been lucky to work at a variety of amazing places,
including Apple (in the Special Project Group),
EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne),
CMU's Robotics Institute,
Google's self-driving car project, and CSIRO in Australia.
You can learn more about my trajectory on my <a href="about/">about</a> page,
or see cool robots I've worked with on my
<a href="videos/">videos</a> page.

If you're interested in my publications, you can also find them
<a href="publications/">here</a>.

Lastly, I have an infrequently-updated <a href="blog/">blog</a> which primarily serves as a space for notes to myself.
