I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).

I completed my PhD in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University.
My research focuses on applying imitation learning techniques to difficult decision-making problems in robotics. I'm primarily interested in problems of human-robot interaction, my recent work is on enabling robots to '''understand natural language in unknown environments'''.
