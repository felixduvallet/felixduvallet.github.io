I am a roboticist working at the intersection of imitation learning, planning and decision-making, and machine learning.
Broadly, I am interested in enabling robots to address challenging problems in smart and useful ways,
and I enjoy getting my hands dirty while working on a wide variety of problems.

I've been lucky to work at a variety of places,
including CMU's Robotics Institute, EPFL,
Google's self-driving car project, and CSIRO in Australia.
You can learn more about my trajectory on my <a href="about/">about</a> page,
or see cool robots I've worked with on my
<a href="videos/">videos</a> page.

If you're interested in my publications, you can also find them
<a href="publications/">here</a>.

Lastly, I have an infrequently-updated <a href="blog/">blog</a> which primarily serves as a space for notes to myself.
