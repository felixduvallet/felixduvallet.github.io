I am a roboticist working at the intersection of imitation learning, planning and decision-making, and machine learning.
Broadly, I am interested in enabling robots to address challenging problems in smart and useful ways,
and I enjoy getting my hands dirty while working on a wide breadth of problems.

I've been lucky to work at a variety of places,
including CMU's Robotics Institute, EPFL,
Google's self-driving car project, and CSIRO in Australia.
You can learn more about my trajectory on my [about](/about) page,
or see cool robots I've been lucky to work with on my [videos](/videos) page.

If you're interested in my publications, you can also find them [here](/publications).

Lastly, I have an infrequently-updated [blog](/blog) which primarily serves as a space for notes to myself.
