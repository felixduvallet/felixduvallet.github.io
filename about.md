title: About Me
---

I am a roboticist working at the intersection of machine learning, planning and decision-making, and imitation learning.
If it's a challenging problem that would make robots more useful for someone out there, I am most likely interested.

I am currently an engineer at Apple in the Special Projects Group.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de
Lausanne (EPFL) in the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory, working with
Prof. Aude Billard.

I completed a PhD in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.ri.cmu.edu).
My research focused on applying imitation learning techniques to difficult decision-making problems in robotics.
My thesis was on getting robots to understand natural-language directions in unstructured unknown environments.

#### Collaborators, past and present.

I've been lucky to work with some amazing people, listed below in (roughly) most-to-least recent order below.

At EPFL, I was working with
[Jos√© Medina](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nLMmnkYAAAAJ&hl=en),
[Klas Kronander](http://kronander.ch/), and
[Aude Billard](http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=115671) along with other members of the
[Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory](http://lasa.epfl.ch/) (LASA).

During my time at CMU, I worked with my advisor
[Tony Stentz](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/person.html?type=publications&person_id=299), and also
[Drew Bagnell](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/person.html?person_id=689),
[Tom Kollar](http://www.tkollar.com/), and
[Manuela Veloso](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/),
as well as researchers from
[Nicholas Roy](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/)'s Robust Robotics Group at MIT, principally
[Matthew Walter](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~mwalter/),
[Tom Howard](http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~th003j/), and
[Sachi Hemachandra](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sachih/home/?page_id=14).

Before starting graduate school I spent one year in Australia at CSIRO, working primarily with
[Ash Tews](https://theconversation.com/profiles/ashley-tews-19879)
and other members of the
[Autonomous Systems Lab](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASL/Autonomous+Systems).

During my undergraduate at CMU, I was fortunate to do research with
[Sanjiv Singh](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~ssingh/Sanjiv_Singh/home.html),
[George Kantor](http://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~kantor/George_Kantors_Home_Page/Home.html),
[Howie Choset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./choset/),
and many of the great professors there.

### Dissertation

I successfully defended my thesis on [natural language direction following for robots in unstructured unknown environments](/pubs/dissertation-felixd.pdf) in January of 2015.
My thesis committee consisted of Tony Stentz, Drew Bagnell, Manuela Veloso, and Nick Roy (MIT).

### Other interests

Besides enabling robots to do cool and useful things, I am a big fan of mountains.

I've been lucky to climb in a variety of places around the world;
some highlights have been in
Switzerland (Eiger, Matterhorn),
France (around Chamonix),
Canada (Bugaboos),
Wyoming (Pingora, Gannett Peak),
and Morocco (Mt. Toubkal).

More recently, I've gotten interested in [Ski Touring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_touring) and Ski Mountaineering, and in 2016 completed the mythical [Haute Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_Route#Grande_Lui_variation) ski tour through France, Italy, and Switzerland.
