I am a robotics researcher.

### Research

### Interests

Besides enabling robots to do cool and useful things, I am a big fan of mountains.

I've been lucky to climb in a variety of places around the world;
some highlights have been in
Switzerland (Eiger, Matterhorn),
France (Aiguille du Midi),
Canada (Bugaboos),
Wyoming (Pingora, Gannett Peak),
and Morocco (Mt. Toubkal).

More recently, I've gotten interested in [Ski Touring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_touring) and Ski Mountaineering, and in 2016 completed the mythical [Haute Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_Route#Grande_Lui_variation) ski tour through France, Italy, and Switzerland.
