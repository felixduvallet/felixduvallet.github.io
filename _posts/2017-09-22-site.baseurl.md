title: site.baseurl issue
---

For some reason my pages' {% raw %}`{{ site.baseurl }}`{% endraw %} macro was not properly replaced
with "/". This broke all the CSS & links across the website.

The fix was to replace {% raw %}`{{ site.baseurl }}`{% endraw %} with:
{% raw %}`{{ "/" | relative_url }}`{% endraw %}
in all the html code.

This worked on both the local and the published page.

Thanks to various github [bug reports] for the fix.
