title: Alt-tick in Linux
---

In Ubuntu/Mint, alt-back_tick is an annoying shortcut with no easy way to disable it.
It conflicts with PyCharm's shortcuts unless disabled.

After some trolling through launchpad bug reports and stackoverflow questions, here is how to disable it:

 - install dconf-editor
 - look for keys bound to <Alt>Above_Tab:

        $ gsettings list-recursively | grep Above_Tab

   In my case, this was the following keys:

        org.cinnamon.desktop.keybindings.wm switch-group
        org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-group

 - Change those settings (in dconf-editor) to ['disabled']
