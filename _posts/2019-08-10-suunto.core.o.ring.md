title: Suunto Core O-ring replacement
---

I recently had to replace the O-ring in my Suunto Core altimeter watch.

Rather than buy their replacement kit, I found an equivalent O-ring, which I
purchased from my favorite online parts shop.

Primarily for my own reference (since I may have to do this again), here are the
dimensions for the part I ordered:

 - Inner diameter: 26mm
 - Outer diameter: 28mm
 - Width: 1mm
