title: ssh at EPFL
---

By default, EPFL blocks all external SSH access (for example, to your office
machine). To access the machine, you must go through a gateway service called
tremplin (trampoline).

First, you need to create an account before you can use this server (one-time
thing): https://tremplin.epfl.ch/ssh.cgi. You need your sciper number for this,
the password is your gaspar password.

Each time you want to access an internal machine as from the outside world:

    ssh -f -N -L2222:your_machine.epfl.ch:22 your_sciper@tremplin.epfl.ch
    ssh -p 2222 your_user@localhost

Replace the epfl internal hostname with your machine's, the sciper number with
yours, and the username with the username on your local machine (not your EPFL
login.
