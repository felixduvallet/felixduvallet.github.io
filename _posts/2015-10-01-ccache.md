title: ccache will speed up your compilation game
---

Installing ccache creates several symlinks to compilers in `/usr/lib/`.
To make ccache used by default (system-wide), just *pre*pend /usr/lib/ccache to the
PATH.
This will make sure ccache gets called instead of cc/gcc/g++/etc, so it can do its magic and only call your compiler if it needs to.

{% highlight bash %}

# Enable ccache by prepending its directory to the path: ccache will get called
# instead of the compiler.
export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH

{% endhighlight %}
