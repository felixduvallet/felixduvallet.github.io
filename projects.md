## Research

#### Human-Robot Handovers
We developed a human-inspired controller that could perform fast and fluent handovers (bi-directionally) between a human and robot team.

#### Understanding Natural Language Directions
We addressed the problem of a robot following directions through a completely unknown environment (i.e. without any prior map) and developed an approached based on imitation learning.

#### Generating Maps from Language

Extending the work on following direction, we investigated how robots could use **language as a sensor**, whereby the robot could extend the partial map it has (built using its sensors) with information that was contained in the direction.

#### Imitation Learning for Multi-Robot Coordination

We looked at how a team of robots could learn to allocate tasks using expert demonstrations, by learning the task allocation utility function.
